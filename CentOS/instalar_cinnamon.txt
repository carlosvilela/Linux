Install Cinnamon In CentOS

While there are many different graphical user interfaces available for Linux, in this example we will be using Cinnamon.

First we need to configure the EPEL repository, as this is where we will be installing packages from.

[root@centos7 ~]# yum install epel-release -y
Next I needed to install the “Server with GUI” group before proceeding. Note that this will also install GNOME, you’ll be able to change to Cinnamon later though.

[root@centos7 ~]# yum groupinstall "Server with GUI" -y
Installing the Cinnamon Desktop is now as simple as installing the “cinnamon” package, which then has many dependencies to install many more packages that are required for a GUI installation.

[root@centos7 ~]# yum install cinnamon -y
Note that this may take a while, on my minimal installation I needed to download around 40 packages which took up about 135MB on top of the Server with GUI package group.

Start The GUI

By default after installing these packages, the default target should have automatically updated, meaning that after a reboot the GUI will automatically be loaded. We can check the current default target as shown below.

[root@centos7 ~]# systemctl get-default
graphical.target
In this instance the target has been updated appropriately by installing these package groups. If it instead said multi-user.target, then you would need to update it manually.

The target is similar to the old run levels, in this case multi-user.target is equivalent to run level 3 meaning that after a reboot the GUI will not be loaded here. We can set the default to the graphical.target which is equivalent to run level 5.

[root@centos7 ~]# systemctl set-default graphical.target
Removed symlink /etc/systemd/system/default.target.
Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/default.target to /usr/lib/systemd/system/graphical.target.

[root@centos7 ~]# systemctl get-default
graphical.target
While this has changed the default target which is accessed during system boot, our current target is still the multi-user.target. We can change to the GUI by performing ‘systemctl isolate graphical.target’ which will change us to the GUI immediately.

[root@centos7 ~]# systemctl isolate graphical.target
Alternatively a system reboot would also work, as all future boots should boot to the graphical target by default.

When you’re at the login screen, simply select the cog icon and pick Cinnamon, as shown below. This preference should be remembered and automatically selected for next time.

Select Cinnamon at login

Removing Cinnamon

If you’ve installed the GUI on a server and realized that it was a terrible mistake, don’t worry! We can also undo this by simply using yum to remove the cinnamon package.

[root@centos7 ~]# yum remove cinnamon
Carefully read through the packages that will be removed and ensure that this looks correct prior to removing packages or dependencies.
